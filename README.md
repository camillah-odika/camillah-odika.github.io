# 👩🏽‍💻 Camillah Odika | Data Engineer | Azure Enthusiast | Power BI Developer

Hi there! I'm Camillah — a Certified Data Engineer with a background in Public Health and a deep passion for transforming data into insight. 
Recently, I completed a comprehensive Smart Data certification where I mastered real-world skills in cloud data engineering, visualization, and analytics.

## 📚 What I Learned
- **Azure Data Factory** – Data pipelines, ingestion, and orchestration
- **Azure Machine Learning** – Model training, evaluation, and deployment
- **Microsoft Fabric** – Lakehouse, Warehouse, Dataflows, and seamless integration
- **Power BI** – Data modeling, report building, and dashboards
- **Python** – Working with APIs, JSON, automation, data wrangling
- **Notebooks** – Running interactive data experiments in Microsoft Fabric

## 💡 Final Group Project (Crypto Data Dashboard)
As part of my certification, I worked on a group project that focused on visualizing **real-time and historical crypto coin data**.

### ✅ Project Highlights:
- Used **CoinGecko API** to extract data for 10 cryptocurrencies
- **My role** involved successful extraction and transformation of real-time data using Python
- Collaborated on a team that:
  - Flattened nested JSON structures
  - Combined real-time and historical datasets
  - Loaded data into **Lakehouse**, then mapped to **Warehouse**
  - Built **Power BI dashboards** for crypto intelligence reporting
- Used Microsoft Fabric end-to-end: Lakehouse ➝ Dataflow ➝ Warehouse ➝ Power BI
